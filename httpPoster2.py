"""Software to receive sensor readings from data sources and post
them to a HTTP URL.  Readings are cached if an Internet connection 
is not available, or the the post fails for any reason.

TO DO:
    * Test separate threads writing to post_time_file simultaneously
    * Perhaps abandon post if it isn't successful after a few retries. It would
        be left in the 'processing' queue, so would get tried again upon a 
        restart. This protects against some bad format locking up a post worker.
        But if post is abandoned and Internet comes back, it will be left in
        processing queue.
